    //That is Row 1 would pertain to Student 1 and the scores that this student 
    //has obtained is stored in various columns in row 1.  Assuming that there are 
    //12 students in a class and 4 subjects, write a program that would do the following:
    //  a.Compute the total marks obtained each student.
    //  b.Compute the class average and standard deviation* of Marks for each subject.
    //  c.Determine the overall average of marks for the whole class for each subjects.

    //Note:   
    //calculation of standard deviation is not required for first time exercise 
    //you may only compute the average – those needing additional practice 
    //may compute standard deviation)

    //Standard Deviation is square root of variance where Variance is given by:
    //	VARIANCE = { [SUM OF(Xi - M)2] / N }; i = 1 to N
    //      N is number of data elements(Xi) and
    //      M is mean(average).
